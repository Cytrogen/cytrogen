# Welcome to [Cytrogen](https://github.com/Cytrogen)'s Territory

I'm a college freshman student this year, right now learning React + NestJS + MongoDB tech stack. Goal for the year is to complete IBM's Full Stack Development MicroBachelor's program.

In the past, I mainly learned Python to web scrape, and to build QQ bots with Nonebot2 + GoCqhttp.

I have interests in blogging. My [blog site](https://cytrogen.icu) uses Hexo engine. (Unfortunately, the blog posts are written in Simplified Chinese only, and I won't consider writing English ones recently)

I am interested in game development but not much; I can draw but not much; I am "tone deaf" (not really but you know); I am learning Japanese.
